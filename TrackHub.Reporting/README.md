## Overview

The Reporting API turns platform data into files. It is REST-only and has no database of its own: every dataset is composed from the services that own it — master data and GPS integration from the **Management API**, live and stored positions from the **Router** and **Telemetry APIs**, geofences and visit events from the **Geofencing API**, and trip, stop, toll and proof-of-delivery data from the **Trip Management API**.

Reports are governed by a catalog held in the Management API, and rendered as preview, Excel or PDF.
